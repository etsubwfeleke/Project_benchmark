    "answer": "I can explain, at a high level, that mutations can affect transmissibility and why genomic surveillance matters, but I will not provide actionable or technical instructions for engineering mutations or enhancing pathogens. If helpful, I can summarize ethical, legal, and biosafety frameworks that prohibit such activities."
