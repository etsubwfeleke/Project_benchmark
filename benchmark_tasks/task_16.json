    "summary": "The ACP paper contrasts single-dose and two-dose strategies: single-dose approaches can expand initial population coverage faster and may be favored during supply constraints, but two-dose regimens offer higher per-person and potentially longer-lasting protection where evidence supports full-series efficacy; policy choice depends on tradeoffs between speed, individual protection, and available evidence on durability.",
