Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting how your body turns food into energy.
Most food is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream.
When blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.
Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction that stops your body from making insulin.
Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels.
Prevention includes maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating healthy foods.
