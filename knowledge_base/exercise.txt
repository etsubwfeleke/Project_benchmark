Regular physical activity is one of the most important things for health.
Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week.
Exercise helps control weight, reduces risk of heart disease, and strengthens bones and muscles.
It can improve mental health, mood, and ability to do daily activities.
Types of exercise include aerobic activities, strength training, flexibility exercises, and balance activities.
Starting slowly and gradually increasing intensity is important for safety.
