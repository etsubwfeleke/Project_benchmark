\fs17\fsmilli8966 Abstract: 
\fs18\fsmilli9056 The advent of the COVID-19 vaccine signified a historic milestone in the field of vacci-\
nology, showcasing remarkable scientific collaboration and global solidarity. However, the most\

\fs17\fsmilli8966 prominent hurdle in maximizing the global public health impact of vaccines remains the absence of\

\fs17\fsmilli8895 comprehensive and inclusive health systems in both high- and low-resource settings. Our discussion\

\fs18\fsmilli9056 centers around the major contributing factors that played a key role in formulating the rapid and\

\fs18\fsmilli9002 efficacious COVID-19 vaccines. Simultaneously, we illuminate the disparities that have marred the\

\fs17\fsmilli8989 vaccine delivery process throughout the pandemic. In particular, we highlight the case scenarios of\

\fs18\fsmilli9052 two minority and vulnerable communities from the Global South and North\'97the undocumented\

\fs17\fsmilli8940 migrants in Thailand and the Roma community in Europe\'97who continue to experience inequitable\

\fs18\fsmilli9056 vaccine access regardless of their location. We note that a crucial programmatic solution that is\

\fs17\fsmilli8881 rooted in inclusive and equitable global public health policy, characterized by empathy and trust and\

\fs17\fsmilli8877 bolstered by digital innovation, is lacking. These examples underscore the significance of establishing\

\fs18\fsmilli9056 a comprehensive and integrated health system at multiple levels across countries and the entire\

\fs17\fsmilli8922 world. Furthermore, we highlight the need for both local and global actors to collaboratively engage\

\fs17\fsmilli8962 in vaccine distribution efforts. By gaining a concise grasp of these intricacies, the global community\

\fs17\fsmilli8966 will be better poised to effectively combat future pandemics and emerging health challenges.\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 1. Introduction\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 One of the main driving forces behind the funding for the rapid development of\

\fs19\fsmilli9978 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines was undoubtedly the disease\'92s pervasive-\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 ness in both low-income and high-income nations. This dynamic set it apart from past\
outbreaks caused by various tropical diseases such as Nipah, Chikungunya, etc. which\
had to contend with significant funding crises or scientific efforts in containment [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 1
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ,
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 2
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ].\
The geographical location, disruption in trade, and travel, and affected population have\

\fs19\fsmilli9948 always been important factors in global efforts for disease prevention and control [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 3
\fs19\fsmilli9948 \cf3 ]. The\
current COVID-19 pandemic reflects a similar trajectory. An estimated 60% of the world\'92s\

\fs20\fsmilli10017 manufacturing demand is satisfied by the USA, China, Korea, Italy, Japan, and Germany,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 which also accounts for around 50% of global exports and 55% of the supply chain [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 4
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ].\
The substantial economic burden of COVID-19 in these nations had a profound impact\

\fs20\fsmilli10022 on international trade, business, and travel, and both larger and smaller economies were\

\fs15\fsmilli7970 Challenges 2023, 14, 45. https://doi.org/10.3390/challe14040045 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/challengesChallenges 2023, 14, 45 2 of 9\

\fs20\fsmilli10012 severely affected [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 5
\fs20\fsmilli10012 \cf3 ]. Alongside the public health implications, the rapid development of\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 vaccines emerged as the most effective and efficient approach to tackle this widespread\
obstruction to global commerce [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 6
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. However, it takes 10.71 years on average to develop\
a vaccine, starting from the understanding of the causative agents or target component\

\fs19\fsmilli9968 (e.g., 50 spike protein) [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 7
\fs19\fsmilli9968 \cf3 ]. While the regulatory process usually takes a considerable time,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 it was comparatively simpler for COVID-19 vaccines. The European Medicines Agency\

\fs19\fsmilli9868 (EMA) was willing to grant approval to vaccines with efficacy levels below 50% [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 8
\fs19\fsmilli9868 \cf3 ] and the\

\fs19\fsmilli9997 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 COVID-19 vaccines with similar efficacy [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 9
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ]. In fact, both the EMA and FDA issued an EUA\

\fs20\fsmilli10047 in December 2020 [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 10
\fs20\fsmilli10047 \cf3 ]. Collaborative data sharing among scientific communities played\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 a pivotal role as well. An example is the adenovirus-vectored MERS vaccine ChAdOx1\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 (which also targets the spike protein of viruses within the same family) which demonstrated\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 previous scientific progress in a fantastic way [\cf4 11\cf3 ].\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 The funding process, which usually is a major challenge, was also easier in the case\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 of COVID-19 vaccines. The US \'91Operation Warp Speed (OWS)\'92 initiative alone invested\

\fs19\fsmilli9918 $18 billion, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Euro-\

\fs19\fsmilli9983 pean Commission invested $1.4 billion and $8 billion, respectively, for COVID-19 vaccine\

\fs19\fsmilli9958 development [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 12
\fs19\fsmilli9958 \cf3 ,
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 13
\fs19\fsmilli9958 \cf3 ]. With few exceptions, political leaders in both developing and devel-\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 oped countries treated this situation seriously and contributed to the global partnership.\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 For instance, regulations were adopted in many countries to expedite the approval of\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 vaccine products and enforce lockdown and personal protective measures [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 14
\fs19\fsmilli9903 \cf3 ,
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 15
\fs19\fsmilli9903 \cf3 ]. Further-\

\fs19\fsmilli9978 more, mass awareness, media campaigning, and concurrent mixed trials in various study\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 sites contributed to the release of several COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca, Pfizer-\

\fs19\fsmilli9953 BioNTech, Sinopharm, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, etc.) into the market in 2021, a mere\

\fs19\fsmilli9938 year after the pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 16
\fs19\fsmilli9938 \cf3 ]. These\

\fs19\fsmilli9888 collective endeavors and initiatives will undoubtedly be remembered as a global solidarity\

\fs20\fsmilli10002 milestone and a historical miracle in the field of vaccine development. However, did this\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 success story extend to the distribution process? Was the global community attentive to\

\fs19\fsmilli9883 the needs of vulnerable populations? Did these populations receive the vaccines they most\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 urgently required?\
2. Global Public Policy versus Vaccine Diplomacy\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 COVID-19 forged a connection between politics and public health in a manner that\

\fs19\fsmilli9913 has never been seen before. However, this alliance faltered during the vaccine distribution\

\fs19\fsmilli9908 phase. Political decision is one of the key factors affecting the equitable resource allocation\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 and distribution of healthcare tools, including vaccines. The foremost obstacle to equitable\

\fs19\fsmilli9918 COVID-19 vaccine distribution is vaccine nationalism, where affluent nations secure prior-\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 ity access to vaccines using legal contracts (advance purchase agreements) with vaccine\
companies [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 17
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Despite accounting for only 13% of the global population, high-income\
countries booked almost 51% of the available vaccine doses [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 18
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. This disregard for the\
needs of lower-income countries with higher populations and disease burden is deeply\
concerning. We believe that vaccines should be considered a \'91global public good\'92. Un-\
fortunately, the World Health Assembly (WHA) which convened in May 2020 failed to\
stand for the \'91Health for All\'92 mandate of the WHO in this context [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 19
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Providentially,\
this caused vaccine diplomacy to garner more attention than at any other time since its\
inception. Vaccine diplomacy encompasses any form of global health diplomacy that\

\fs19\fsmilli9918 centers on the administration or utilization of vaccines, particularly as a means of humani-\

\fs19\fsmilli9893 tarian intervention [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 20
\fs19\fsmilli9893 \cf3 ]. In this new era of vaccine diplomacy, a global vaccination strategy\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 has emerged to facilitate more equitable vaccine distribution to some extent. This global\

\fs19\fsmilli9913 partnership called \'91\'92The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility\'94, formulated\

\fs19\fsmilli9928 by the WHO, CEPI, and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), stands as\

\fs20\fsmilli10042 one of the most effective approaches to ensure vaccine availability for at least 20% of the\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 population in 92 countries irrespective of their economic situation [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 21
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Still, the success\
of this great initiative depends on the global leadership and policymakers which can be
\fs15\fsmilli7970 Challenges 2023, 14, 45 3 of 9\

\fs19\fsmilli9908 jeopardized if a concrete policy binding is not in place. Nevertheless, poor people in many\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 countries continue to face challenges related to the trust in political leadership and scientific\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 resources upon which successful vaccine delivery and optimum coverage largely de-\

\fs19\fsmilli9898 pend [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 22
\fs19\fsmilli9898 \cf3 ]. This underscores the intricate interplay between global and local health policies\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 on vaccine diplomacy.\
3. Tale of Minorities in the Pandemic\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 The COVID-19 pandemic brought attention to the inequalities and disparities that\
affect the most vulnerable people across all countries, particularly refugees and irregu-\
lar/undocumented migrants [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 23
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. The international migrant population reached up to\
281 million in 2020, representing 3.6% of the world\'92s population [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 24
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Refugees and mi-\
grants face a higher susceptibility to COVID-19 than the host population due to their\

\fs20\fsmilli10047 living conditions, often characterized by overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 resources to maintain physical distance [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 25
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Despite scientific evidence illustrating the\
unequal sufferings of COVID-19 among displaced, minority ethnic, and specific racial\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 communities, these populations were not given priority in the global vaccine discourse [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 26
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ].\

\fs20\fsmilli10017 As of March 2022 data, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that\

\fs19\fsmilli9888 only 53% of countries (n = 95 out of 180) where irregular/undocumented migrants operate\

\fs19\fsmilli9868 have access to COVID-19 vaccines, and only 47% of countries (n = 85 out of 180) in the case\

\fs19\fsmilli9908 of internally displaced people (IDPs) [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 27
\fs19\fsmilli9908 \cf3 ]. Even though 85% of refugees live in developing\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 countries, they are most often undermined by the vaccination policy [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 28
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. A major legal\
constraint is that the 1951 Refugee Convention has not been signed by many countries\

\fs19\fsmilli9888 hosting large numbers of refugees and undocumented migrants such as India, Bangladesh,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 29
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Though there are instances\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 where non-signatory countries have provided vaccines to refugees, the Refugee Convention\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 continues to hold a significant role in vaccination efforts. Member countries are obligated\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 to provide vaccinations and can be influenced to do so through UN agencies. However,\

\fs19\fsmilli9988 for the non-signatory countries mentioned above, migrant workers\'92 access to vaccination\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 depends on mercy, resource availability, and the national interest of the host country. In\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 addition, the intervention capacity of UN agencies is also limited in such cases.\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 The living conditions of migrants often pose a greater risk of infectious diseases due to\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 factors such as overcrowding, poor living conditions, and limited access to health care. All\

\fs19\fsmilli9923 states are required to protect the right to health and non-discrimination for all individuals,\

\fs20\fsmilli10037 including migrants. The provision of vaccines to migrants regardless of their nationality,\
immigration status, or other prohibited grounds of discrimination is an essential compo-\

\fs20\fsmilli10032 nent of meeting these obligations [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 30
\fs20\fsmilli10032 \cf3 ]. Undocumented migrants frequently face a higher\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 risk of infection because they work in essential or frontline occupations without proper\

\fs19\fsmilli9948 protective gear. They are frequently excluded from the social safety measures provided to\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 the general population by governments during consecutive lockdowns. Consequently, they\

\fs20\fsmilli10042 can potentially serve as carriers of infectious diseases, contributing to their transmission\

\fs19\fsmilli9997 to a broader population [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 31
\fs19\fsmilli9997 \cf3 ]. Providing vaccines to migrants can help prevent the spread\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 of diseases to the wider community and protect public health [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 32
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ], helping to promote\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 health equity and ensuring that all members of society have access to essential healthcare\

\fs20\fsmilli10032 services [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 33
\fs20\fsmilli10032 \cf3 ]. Therefore, in this paper, we presented the undocumented migrant workers\

\fs19\fsmilli9958 in Thailand as a case scenario due to their vulnerability and the discrimination they faced\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 within the local health system which resulted from broader global health policies and\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 diplomatic initiatives.\
4. Undocumented Migrants in Thailand: Unprivileged Community without Care in\
the Global South\

\fs19\fsmilli9978 According to the 2019 migration report, Thailand is a regional hub in Southeast Asia\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 with 3.9 million migrant workers (of which one-third are undocumented) from its neighbor-\

\fs19\fsmilli9883 ing countries of Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 34
\fs19\fsmilli9883 \cf3 ]. Regrettably, undocumented\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 migrants are excluded from coverage under the Thai Social Security Schemes (SSS) and any
\fs15\fsmilli7970 Challenges 2023, 14, 45 4 of 9\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 other forms of health insurance [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 35
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ]. Consequently, they face difficulties in accessing health-\

\fs19\fsmilli9997 care services [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 36
\fs19\fsmilli9997 \cf3 ]. This situation disproportionately affects migrant children and workers\

\fs19\fsmilli9988 with chronic illnesses [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 37
\fs19\fsmilli9988 \cf3 ]. The challenges they face have been significantly compounded\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 38
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. For example, undocumented Myanmar\

\fs19\fsmilli9968 migrant workers experience public discrimination, lack of medical care, and fear of arrest\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 or detention, leading to notable mental health repercussions [\cf4 39\cf3 ].\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 In the case of the Thai Labor Ministry\'92s decision to vaccinate only those migrant work-\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 ers covered by the SSS, an estimated 1.3 million undocumented migrant workers without\

\fs19\fsmilli9938 SSS coverage were left without receiving any vaccine dose [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 40
\fs19\fsmilli9938 \cf3 ]. Furthermore, the lack of a\

\fs19\fsmilli9873 traceable database of undocumented migrant workers in Thailand also implies the absence\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 of vaccination information for this vulnerable group [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 41
\fs20\fsmilli10052 \cf3 ]. However, the health authority\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 can potentially reach the undocumented migrant workers in collaboration with civil society\

\fs19\fsmilli9873 organizations, community-based organizations, various labor organizations, and volunteer\

\fs19\fsmilli9928 groups which could facilitate the dissemination of vital emergency information, including\

\fs19\fsmilli9918 pandemic preparedness and vaccination guidance [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 42
\fs19\fsmilli9918 \cf3 ]. Interestingly, the solution adopted\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 by the Thai government involved offering a period of regularization (based on cabinet\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 resolution and employers\'92 endorsement) to irregular/undocumented migrant workers [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 43
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ].\

\fs20\fsmilli10032 Those who successfully completed the registration process were permitted to work until\

\fs20\fsmilli10037 2023. Yet, the cost associated with the health examination was approximately 7200 baths\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 (240 USD), which excluded transportation, registration fees, and broker service charges\
for the facilitation of registration [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 44
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ] and was not practical or affordable for individuals\

\fs19\fsmilli9913 who have lost their employment and livelihood during the pandemic. Unfortunately, Thai\

\fs20\fsmilli10042 authorities continued to detain undocumented workers and either deported or confined\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 them in camps [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 45
\fs19\fsmilli9903 \cf3 ]. These legal actions further deter migrants from seeking treatment and\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 COVID-19 vaccination. Obviously, the undocumented migrants would be afraid to disclose\
their illness and their motivation for vaccination. Additionally, there is public prejudice and\

\fs19\fsmilli9938 stigma against migrant workers, as they are often portrayed as virus spreaders, leading to\

\fs19\fsmilli9883 their exclusion from healthcare services [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 46
\fs19\fsmilli9883 \cf3 ]. Amidst community lockdowns, social stigma,\

\fs20\fsmilli10037 unemployment, legal interventions, the lack of digital information available in migrants\'92\

\fs19\fsmilli9953 language, and limited awareness programs, a significant portion of this population group\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 lives in fear and exhibits limited interest in being vaccinated [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 47
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ]. All these factors reinforce\

\fs20\fsmilli10032 the importance of robust global public policies that ensure equitable access to healthcare\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 services at the local level.\
5. Roma People in Europe: Low Profile in High-Income Settings\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 The Roma people are one of the most underprivileged ethnic groups in Europe,\
with an estimated 12 million population, residing predominantly in slums and informal\
settlements [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 48
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Similar to the undocumented migrants in Thailand, the Roma people\

\fs19\fsmilli9968 are socially and politically stigmatized, often unfairly scapegoated as sources of infection,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 and were placed under strict quarantine (referred to as \'91negative quarantine\'92) during\
the challenging circumstances of the pandemic [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 49
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ,
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 50
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. However, a Hungarian study\

\fs19\fsmilli9923 revealed that the COVID-19 incidence rates in districts with a high Roma population were\

\fs19\fsmilli9933 much lower compared to the national average, while areas with a lower Roma population\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 had higher rates [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 51
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Unfortunately, among the younger age groups, the COVID-19\

\fs20\fsmilli10027 mortality in the Roma population surpassed that of the general population, highlighting\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 their poor health condition and the enduring impact of discrimination [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 48
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. The current\

\fs20\fsmilli10022 pandemic has aggravated the existing social exclusion and inequality faced by the Roma\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 community, including disparities in employment, education, and access to healthcare.\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 Despite living in a technologically advanced continent, this population group has low health\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 literacy and technical know-how, rendering them marginalized from digital or e-health\
COVID-19 services, including vaccination, social support, and awareness messages [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 52
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ].\

\fs19\fsmilli9953 In addition, inadequate communication and discernment from health staff, the absence of\

\fs19\fsmilli9992 culturally oriented services, language barriers, high mobility necessary for livelihood, co-\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 payment requirements, and referral-based health systems collectively jeopardize the health,
\fs15\fsmilli7970 Challenges 2023, 14, 45 5 of 9\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 well-being, and effective vaccination efforts of the Roma community [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 53
\fs20\fsmilli10052 \cf3 ]. Consequently,\

\fs20\fsmilli10007 vaccine coverage was found to be significantly lower among the group, as indicated by a\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 national survey in Hungary [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 54
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. Although historical vaccine hesitancy or low coverage\
is well documented in this population [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 55
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ], specific and effective measures have yet to\
be implemented. Furthermore, in Europe, there are no ethnic data (including that of\

\fs20\fsmilli10037 the Roma population) maintained on COVID-19 vaccine coverage [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 48
\fs20\fsmilli10037 \cf3 ]. This evident gap\

\fs19\fsmilli9978 eventually results in fragmented and incongruent national and global health policies that\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 overlook minority groups in the population. The establishment of a population-based\
digital data repository (e.g., vaccine registry) that includes the vulnerable population at\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 both local and global levels could assist policymakers in making timely, effective, and more\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 inclusive decisions.\
6. Discussion\

\fs19\fsmilli9978 Despite substantial global efforts, financial mobilization, and the successful develop-\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 ment of effective COVID-19 vaccines, the fair distribution of vaccines remains a significant\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 obstacle to achieving healthcare access for all. Within this context, we have identified\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 several pivotal factors pertinent to our specific case population. In this discourse, our major\

\fs19\fsmilli9943 observations encompass vaccination hesitancy, vaccine diplomacy, inequitable vaccine de-\
livery, budget allocation, health system management, the absence of digital infrastructure,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 insufficiently trained health professionals, and more. The successful implementation of\
health interventions, such as vaccination, usually relies on globally coordinated public\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 health policies informed by locally derived research outcomes.\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 It is a fundamental principle that, in the 21st century, no one should be required to\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 present identity proof to access basic life-saving measures like vaccines. Undocumented\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 migrants already face a range of obstacles in accessing COVID-19 vaccination, including the\
lack of access to information in a language they understand, costs, and legal, administrative,\

\fs19\fsmilli9933 and practical barriers [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 30
\fs19\fsmilli9933 \cf3 ]. The fear of detention and expulsion, lack of trust in authorities,\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 confusion about regulations, entitlements, and protections, as well as exposure to an\
immigration enforcement system, may undermine public health efforts to prevent the\
further transmission of COVID-19 by reducing the acceptability of vaccination [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 31
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ,
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 56
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ].\
Given that minority and vulnerable population groups consistently experience higher\
levels of inequality and are often overlooked, a viable approach is the establishment of\

\fs19\fsmilli9903 effective global and local policies and partnerships that regard them as major stakeholders\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 within pandemic preparedness plans [\cf4 57\cf3 ].\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted \'91vaccine diplomacy\'92 as an\
added modifier in the global policy adaptation and accentuated the exclusion of the\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 \'91marginalized population\'92 from local vaccine delivery efforts more prominently than ever.\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 This phenomenon is substantially influenced by the political dominance of the Global\
North, which is often rooted in wealth indices, in contrast to the resource-constrained\

\fs19\fsmilli9883 health systems prevalent in the Global South. Vaccine diplomacy and global policy adapta-\

\fs20\fsmilli10017 tion can result in the migrants in some countries being excluded from receiving vaccines.\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 Vaccine diplomacy can also be influenced by geopolitical considerations, such as national\

\fs20\fsmilli10037 interests, alliances, and power dynamics [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 58
\fs20\fsmilli10037 \cf3 ]. For example, the Chinese government has\

\fs19\fsmilli9973 been providing vaccines to countries in the region and using them to strengthen its diplo-\

\fs19\fsmilli9923 matic ties, while the United States has been donating vaccines and using them to establish\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 US leadership in the field of global health [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 59
\fs20\fsmilli10062 \cf3 ]. This can contribute to health disparities\
and inequalities among migrant populations and undermine efforts to promote global\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 health equity.\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 The lessons gleaned from this experience should be integral in shaping future pan-\

\fs19\fsmilli9992 demic preparedness policies, particularly the notion of vaccine diplomacy. We argue that\

\fs20\fsmilli10032 vaccine diplomacy should be reframed through a decolonized and non-capitalist lens by\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 promoting universal access to vaccines, opposing neocolonial methods, addressing con-\

\fs19\fsmilli9938 flicting political ideologies and methods, investigating novel approaches, and challenging\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 vaccine imperialism. The lopsided distribution of vaccines still results in unequal access
\fs15\fsmilli7970 Challenges 2023, 14, 45 6 of 9\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 to healthcare for migrants, including undocumented immigrants in Thailand. From our\
standpoint, along with the examples highlighted involving undocumented migrants in\
Thailand and the mobile Roma community in Europe, an empathetic, trust-based, and\

\fs20\fsmilli10052 inclusive health policy supported by digital innovations for the comprehensive tracking\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 of vaccination and other health interventions, alongside the promotion of widespread\

\fs19\fsmilli9992 awareness (digital literacy), emerges as a paramount programmatic solution. In addition,\

\fs20\fsmilli10007 the role of an immunization information system (IIS) or vaccine registry proves essential,\

\fs19\fsmilli9948 yet it is lacking in our specific case scenarios, underscoring the necessity for its functional-\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 ity across all settings. To cater to minority and hard-to-reach populations, the provision\
of multilingual information systems and mobile vaccination teams is crucial to ensure\
their inclusion in vaccine coverage. The evident consequences of unequal vaccine dis-\
tribution at local levels not only facilitate the spread of the disease but also enable new\

\fs19\fsmilli9863 variants to emerge [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 60
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ], increasing the burden on healthcare systems [
\fs19\fsmilli9963 \cf4 61
\fs19\fsmilli9863 \cf3 ] and economic and\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 social impacts [\cf4 62\cf3 ].\
7. Conclusions\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 We emphasize the importance of directing attention towards specialized research\
and enhancing health system accessibility for minority populations, including diverse\

\fs20\fsmilli10047 migrants, vulnerable groups, mobile communities, and indigenous peoples, irrespective\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 of their socioeconomic background, health literacy, or legal standing. In addition to the\
comprehensive global policy initiatives advocated by world leaders, policymakers, and\

\fs19\fsmilli9948 UN agencies, we strongly argue for the establishment of an impartial and just vaccination\

\fs20\fsmilli10062 policy in every nation. This policy is crucial to uphold the principle of \'91leaving no one\

\fs19\fsmilli9873 behind\'92 and ensure that it is free of any influence stemming from racial, cultural, economic,\

\fs19\fsmilli9963 or social dynamics.\
