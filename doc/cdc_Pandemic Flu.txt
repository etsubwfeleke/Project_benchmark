\fs17\fsmilli8887 The Trump Administration is working to reopen the government for the American people. Mission-critical activities of CDC will\
continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Certain federal government activities have ceased due to a lack of\
appropriated funding. During the government shutdown, only web sites supporting excepted functions will be updated. As a result,\
the information on this website may not be up to date and the agency may not be able to respond to inquiries.\

\fs54\fsmilli27105 \cf4 About Pandemic Influenza\

\fs18\fsmilli9257 For Everyone\

\fs16\fsmilli8023 MAR. 27, 2024\

\fs18\fsmilli9257 \cf5 PURPOSE\

\fs22\fsmilli11109 \cf6 An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of a new influenza A virus that is very different from current and recently circulating human\
seasonal influenza A viruses.\
Pandemics happen when new (novel) influenza A viruses emerge which are able to infect people easily and spread from person to person\
in an efficient and sustained way.\

\fs38\fsmilli19440 \cf3 Pandemic Basics\

\fs22\fsmilli11109 \cf6 Because the virus is new to humans, very few people will have immunity against the pandemic virus, and a vaccine might not be widely\
available. The new virus will make a lot of people sick. How sick people get will depend on the characteristics of the virus, whether or not people\
have any immunity to that virus, and the health and age of the person being infected. With seasonal flu, for example, certain chronic health\
conditions are known to make those people more susceptible to serious flu infections. The risk factors associated with seasonal flu can be found\
at "\cf7 People at High Risk of Developing Flu\'96Related Complications\cf6 ." Influenza pandemics are uncommon; only occurred during the 20 
\fs15\fsmilli7776 th\

\fs22\fsmilli11109 century.\
How often does it happen? Will most people be immune? Seasonal Flu Pandemic Flu\
Happens annually and usually peaks\
between December and February\
Usually some immunity from previous\
exposures and influenza vaccination\
Rarely happens (three times in 20th\
century)\
Most people have little or no immunity\
because they have no previous exposure to\
the virus or similar viruses\
Who is at risk for complications? Where can I get medical care? Certain people are at high-risk for serious\
complications (infants, elderly, pregnant\
women, extreme obesity and persons with\
certain chronic medical conditions)\
Health care providers and hospitals can\
usually meet public and patient needs\
Healthy people also may be at high risk for\
serious complications\
Health care providers and hospitals may be\
overwhelmed\
Alternate care sites may be available to\
meet public and patient needs\
Will a vaccine be available? Vaccine available for annual flu season\
Usually, one dose of vaccine is needed for\
most people\
Although the US government maintains a\
limited stockpile of pandemic vaccine,\
vaccine may not be available in the early\
stages of a pandemic\
Two doses of vaccine may be needed\

\fs22\fsmilli11109 \cf6 Will antivirals be available?\
Adequate supplies of antivirals are usually\
available\
Antiviral supply may not be adequate to\
meet demand\
How many people could get sick and\
suffer complications?\
Rates of medical visits, complications,\
\cf7 hospitalizations\cf6  and death can vary from\
low to high\
CDC estimates that flu-related\
hospitalizations since 2010 ranged from\
140,000 to 710,000, while flu-related\
deaths are estimated to have ranged from\
12,000 to 56,000.\
Rates of medical visits, complications,\
hospitalizations and death can range from\
moderate to high\
Number of deaths could be much higher\
than seasonal flu (e.g. The estimated U.S.\
death toll during the 1918 pandemic was\
approximately 675,000)\
What impact will it have on schools and\
workplaces?\
Usually causes minor impact on the general\
public, some schools may close and sick\
people are encouraged to stay home\
Manageable impact on domestic and world\
economies\
May cause major impact on the general\
public, such as travel restrictions and\
school or business closings\
Potential for severe impact on domestic\
and world economies\
