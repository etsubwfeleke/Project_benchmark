A trio of current Annals articles each takes a different route to the same conclusion:\
Using initial supplies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines to immunize as\
many persons as possible with a single-dose regimen may achieve more benefit than\
a more effective 2-dose regimen in a smaller population.\
The model of Paltiel and colleagues (\cf6 1\cf5 ) makes the case for a single-dose vaccine, even\
if it is somewhat less effective than a 2-dose regimen of another vaccine. Barnabas and\
Wald (\cf6 2\cf5 ) argue for single-dose immunization campaigns involving the Pfizer/BioNTech\
and Moderna vaccines, despite the absence of long-term efficacy data from clinical\
trials. The model from Tuite and colleagues (\cf6 3\cf5 ) questions the practice of reserving the\
second dose for every person immunized.\
In large-scale trials with tens of thousands of participants, the 2-dose regimens of the\
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both demonstrated about 95% efficacy in\
preventing COVID-19. These studies were designed to test a 2-dose regimen, but the\
data reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised the possibility\
that even a single dose of these vaccines might offer a clinically significant, albeit\
lower, level of protection against the disease. The FDA has issued emergency use\
authorization for a 2-dose regimen of these vaccines, a prime and a booster, 21 days\
apart for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days apart for the Moderna vaccine.\
In a public health emergency, a powerful argument exists for doing something with\
less-than-perfect results if it can help more persons quickly. However, whether\
alternative approaches with current vaccines would accomplish this goal is far from\
clear.\

\fs24 \cf5 Several constraints stand in the way of getting COVID-19 vaccine doses into the arms\
of the persons who stand to benefit most from them. \cf2 Supply c onstr aints in the\
production and procurement of vaccine doses, as well as vials, syringes, and other\
vaccine-related materials, limit or delay their availability to patients and providers.\
A dministr ation c onstr aints are obstacles that emerge in the distribution and\
administration of the vaccines to patients.\cf5  Demand constraints reflect the hurdles that\
exist in vaccinating members of high-risk and high-priority populations who may be\
reluctant to be vaccinated.\
A single-dose regimen of the current vaccines that offers a lower but still substantial\
level of protection against COVID-19 may alleviate vaccine supply constraints, but may\
do so at the expense of aggravating the demand and administration constraints that\
present the greater hurdle to vaccinating vulnerable groups in the United States. The\
United States has historically struggled to vaccinate adults. In the past decade, the\
rate of seasonal influenza vaccination among U.S. adults has never exceeded 50%.\
Coverage rates for seasonal influenza have been even lower for Black and Latinx\
Americans and high-risk adults between the ages of 18 and 49 years (\cf6 4\cf5 ). During the\
last pandemic for which there was a vaccine\'97the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\'97only 22.7% of\
American adults were vaccinated (\cf6 5\cf5 ). After months of wariness, recent polls show that\
interest in receiving COVID-19 vaccines is finally rising among Americans, including\
Black and Latinx populations, in part because of the news that clinical trials showed\
the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to be highly effective (\cf6 6\cf5 ). Offering reluctant\
populations a less effective regimen of a vaccine, or failing to offer its second dose on\
schedule, may cause confusion, create a multitiered system of vaccine access, and\
exacerbate historical concerns that certain groups are more likely to receive\
substandard care.\
In the United States, COVID-19 vaccine administration will depend on the same\
overworked and underresourced U.S. state, local, and tribal public health systems that\
have delivered H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Despite months of pleas for at least $6\
billion to prepare state and local governments for what will be the largest vaccination\

\fs24 \cf5 campaign in U.S. history, Congress only recently appropriated the necessary funds,\
and it will be weeks more before those federal resources are distributed and put to\
good use. In the interim, administration will continue to be a greater challenge than\
limited doses in the early roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. As of December 30, the Centers\
for Disease Control and Prevention reported that only 2.6 million of the 12.4 million\
vaccine doses distributed had been administered to U.S. patients (\cf6 7\cf5 ).\
The United States is unfortunately demonstrating the public health axiom that what\
saves lives is the practice of vaccination, not just the existence of vaccines. The\
immediate task facing the public health system is to deliver vaccines swiftly and surely\
to high-priority populations and, in the process, to build momentum and confidence.\
There are no shortcuts to inspiring trust among those at greatest risk, developing and\
implementing an effective vaccination program, and monitoring for safety and\
effectiveness over time. Models of alternative strategies\'97particularly those that make\
large assumptions about vaccine efficacy in the absence of reliable data\'97should not\
drive policy without a full consideration of the challenges of implementation and\
potential unintended effects.\
Ideas for stretching vaccine supplies may yet have utility, but they will have greater\
application when and where supply constraints are the rate-limiting steps. There is no\
shortage of those settings, because a few wealthy nations, including the United States,\
have already purchased most early supplies of the most promising COVID-19 vaccines\
(\cf6 8\cf5 ). Yet, a moment may soon arrive when COVID-19 vaccine supplies are a greater\
limitation on U.S. vaccination than at present; therefore, considering various\
alternative approaches is worthwhile. For now, the priority should be to grow the\
evidence base by pursuing clinical testing and observational studies to determine\
whether a single dose or a delayed second dose of the current vaccines will generate\
immunity similar to that of the FDA-authorized 2-dose regimen. Supported by strong\
public health systems, rapid vaccine production, and equitable vaccine distribution\
within the United States and around the world, vaccination strategies driven by data\
can bring an end to COVID-19.\

\fs24 \cf2 Patient Confidence\

\fs21 \cf5 I agree totally and completely with the authors regarding our Vaccine issues.\
The error in giving a Vaccine without great efficacy will have the effect of reducing overall\
confidence in the Vaccine.\
We see the same issue now in patients who "got the flu vaccine and still got the Flu". Knowingly\
reducing the chance of 95% protection (Just to make ourselves feel like we did something) will\
lessen our ability to convince patients of it's benefit..\
We need to concentrate on the logistics!!\

\fs24 \cf2 Leveraging Open Science to Accelerate Research in COVID-19 vaccines: which are\
the challenges of exclusive patents?\

\fs21 \cf5 We fully agree with the statements of the Annals\'92 Editorial:\
1. The public health axiom that "what saves lives is the practice of vaccination, not just the\
existence of vaccines".\
2. The immediate task facing the public health system is to deliver vaccines swiftly and surely\
to high-priority populations and, in the process, to build momentum and confidence.\
Accordingly, the world\'92s population needs to be reached by affordable, effective and quick\
vaccination campaigns, thus preventing return waves of the pandemic. To effect this, there needs\
to be patent rights limitation in most countries.\
Vaccine patents are currently guaranteed by international agreements, but high costs and\
safeguarding the interests of a few multinational companies are serious threats that obstruct\
vaccine roll out. From a global problem perspective, patent rights limitation is a step forward and\
may be a mechanism for inspiring trust among skeptical populations at greatest risk, and for\
implementing effective vaccination programs. The chain of knowledge, ideas, research, innovation,\
development, production, distribution, delivery and actual administration should not be the sole\

\fs21 \cf5 prerogative of a few multinationals that purchase and monopolize know-how and supplies with\
their own rules, as if they were themselves sovereign states.\
Even after the call by President Biden for patent liberalization, no medical and scientific society has\
expressed a position, amidst the ongoing debate. This silence further contributes to the distrust of\
large groups of the world\'92s population towards science and medicine.\
We believe that patent rights limitation in the COVID-19 era is a sustainable proposal. In the current\
climate of this international public health emergency, patent liberalisation should be fully\
implemented, following governmental agreements in all countries of the world. The point is not to\
question the right to fair gain for intellectual property of something subject to a patent, but to\
allow, as in this case, the effective utility of the patent itself.\
The wider scenario of public funding and research contributions made these achievements\
possible, and allows further advancement. In our view, removing patent barriers, even temporarily,\
is a needed first step, along with transferring advanced manufacturing know-how. Without patent\
suspension, inevitable prevarication will occur, not justified by any economic, scientific or ethical\
consideration.\
